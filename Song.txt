Memories consume like opening the wound
I'm picking me apart again
You all assume I'm safe here in my room
Unless I try to start again
I don't want to be the one the battles always choose
'Cause inside, I realize that I'm the one confused
I don't know what's worth fighting for or why I have to scream
I don't know why I instigate and say what I don't mean
I don't know how I got this way, I know it's not alright
So I'm breaking the habit
I'm breaking the habit tonight
Clutching my cure, I tightly lock the door
I try to catch my breath again
I hurt much more than anytime before
I had no options left again
